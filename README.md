The case study solutions and summary files are added here.
Goals
Most of the BFSI organizations find it hard to give loans to the people due to their insufficient or non-existent credit history.
The primary objective of the case study is to assist Home Credit in deciding which loan applications should be disbursed, and which should be rejected, based on the applicantâ€™s past behaviour and application information.
